                <dd> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. <br> Your luxury
                    camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold <br> running water. Shower and
                    restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
                <dt>What should i bring?</dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing <br> weather with light
                    layers
                    of clothing. Its also helpful to bring a flashlight and a <br> sense of adventure.</dd>
